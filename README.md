# iOS Tech Challenge

Here at ABA we love Music and we know our users do it also!.

We want to give them the opportunity to learn English by singing their favourite songs.

Actually we have a current section that we would like to improve and restyle.

Usability is a most for us and we would like to have a fresh user experience.

Feel free to modify anything you think would improve the section.

# Here we go!

## How did I implement VIPER?

Basically I have a protocol file for each scene in the app. This file defines the interaction between each layer as following:

* View - Presenter: protocols to notify changes and to inject information to the UI.
* Presenter - Interactor: protocols to request / receive information to / from the interactor.
* Presenter - Router: protocol to define the transitions between scenes.

Whith this protocols file is really easy to know how each layer notify / request / information to the other ones so we don't have any other way to communicate all the layers.

Another important point is because I'm using protocols it's really easy to define mocks views / presenters / interactors / routers for testing.
