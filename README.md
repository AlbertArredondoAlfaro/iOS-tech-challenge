# iOS Tech Challenge

Here at ABA we love Music and we know our users do it also!.

We want to give them the opportunity to learn English by singing their favourite songs.

Actually we have a current section that we would like to improve and restyle.

Usability is a most for us and we would like to have a fresh user experience.

Feel free to modify anything you think would improve the section.

# Here we go!
